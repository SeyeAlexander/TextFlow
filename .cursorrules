# Project Rules

## UI Preservation protocol
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**: Do not change ANY UI element without express, written permission from the user.
- This applies to all visual properties, including but not limited to:
  - Colors (backgrounds, text, borders)
  - Typography (font sizes, weights, families)
  - Spacing (margins, paddings, layout)
  - Components (buttons, inputs, cards)
  - Animations and transitions
- **Implementation Constraint**: If a backend or logic implementation requires a UI modification (e.g., adding a loading state, error message), you must **STOP and ASK** for permission before proceeding with that specific UI change.

## Development Standards
- **Package Manager**: ALL commands must use `pnpm`.
  - Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm run build`, `pnpm add`, etc.
  - Do not use `npm` or `yarn` unless explicitly instructed to debug a specific issue with them.
